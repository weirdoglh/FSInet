## Simulation for cortico-striatal circuit

### Code

Simulation is run with nest simulator [https://www.nest-simulator.org/].

Codes for across-trial variability and within-trial correlation are given in **run_var.py** and **run_cor.py**

Corresponding data processing and figure generation are given in ipynb.

### Processed data

Processed data and figures are in exp folder with var (across-trial variability) and mmo (within-trial correlation)
